<p>This is my new website where I’ll be providing resources related to
my research and considering some of the bigger challenges facing ocean and climate researchers.</p>

<p>I’m a newcomer to building websites, having used a simple widget to put things
together during my <a href="https://www2.physics.ox.ac.uk/contacts/people/brannigan">phd</a>.
I’ve found the process of putting together a basic website to be surprisingly
straighforward.  This is because I’ve built this site
using <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/">jekyll</a>, an open source … something … for
building websites.  I chose jekyll as it ties in nicely with github, where
I’m hoping to be more open about posting the code I use to analyse observations
and model simulations.</p>

<p>The main advantage of using jekyll is similar to the main advantage of using
github in that you can access the code of other more advanced users to reduce
the learning curve a bit.  I’ve found the websites of <a href="http://rabernat.github.io/">Ryan Abernathey</a>
and <a href="https://crocha700.github.io/">Cesar Rocha</a> to be particularly inspiring.
I also appreciate design guru <a href="https://rsms.me/">Rasmus Andersson</a> making
his site code open source to see how simple but effective design works in
practice.</p>

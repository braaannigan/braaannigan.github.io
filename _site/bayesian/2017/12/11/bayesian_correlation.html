<p>Bayesian methods are a powerful tool for understanding uncertainty in our
datasets and the strengths and weaknesses of our models.  I’m writing a series
of blog posts about how Bayesian methods can be used in practice in oceanography.</p>

<p>The second post in this series shows how to estimate correlation using a
Bayesian approach.  The post is an interactive Jupyter notebook that
you can access in two ways.</p>

<h2 id="online-and-interactive-from-the-cloud">Online and interactive from the cloud</h2>
<p>You can run the notebook from the cloud
<a href="https://github.com/braaannigan/explore_data"><strong>by going to this repository</strong></a> and
hitting the ‘launch binder’ button in the readme below the file list.<br />
You then hit the launch
button on the next page and wait patiently for a minute while the interactive
notebook environment is created.  You then open the ‘bayes_correlation.ipynb’
notebook and you can then use it as you would a notebook on your own machine.</p>

<p>The first notebook ‘bayes_moc_gaussian.ipynb’ on fitting a statistical distribution
to a dataset is also available in the repository.</p>

<h2 id="offline-and-interactive-on-your-local-machine">Offline and interactive on your local machine</h2>
<p>If you’d prefer to run the notebook on your own machine, you can clone or
download <a href="https://github.com/braaannigan/explore_data"><strong>the same repository</strong></a>
using the green button on the top-right of the repository page.  Cloning
or downloading the repository will also
download the data files that are in the <em>data</em> sub-directory.</p>

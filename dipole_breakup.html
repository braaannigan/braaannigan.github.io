## Observed sub-surface eddies in the Arctic
<img src="/img/arctic_dipoles/itp3_anticyc.jpg" width="70%">

A sub-surface anticyclone observed around Day 143
from an ice-tethered profiler in May 2006. The largest buoyancy anomaly
is in the halocline around 50 m depth (b), but there is also a weaker
surface buoyancy anomaly (a). The colour scale in (d) is based on that
used for (a).

---
## Initial condition used for simulations
<img src="/img/arctic_dipoles/initial_cond_3d.jpg" width="70%">

The model domain is doubly-periodic and about 90 m deep. There are two
independant fronts with opposite orientation. A positive zonal surface
stress leads to a downfront stress at the northern front but an upfront
stress at the southern front.

---
#### Dipole formation with zero surface stress
<img src="/img/arctic_dipoles/rv_stress_comp_day44.jpg" width="65%" align="middle">

With zero surface stress (left panels) cyclone-anticyclone dipoles form.
They tend to follow curved paths that bring them back to the front. The dipole
trajectory is shown by the black dots.

---
#### Dipole formation under an upfront stress
<img src="/img/arctic_dipoles/rv_stress_comp_day44.jpg" width="65%">

With an upfront surface stress (centre panels)
dipoles also emerge from the front. However, in this case the mixed-layer
cyclone eventually travels south in the direction of the Ekman transport,
while the sub-surface anticyclone remains in place as an isolated
sub-surface eddy.  This is shown in the movie on the next slide.

#### Dipole formation under a downfront stress
<img src="/img/arctic_dipoles/rv_stress_comp_day44.jpg" width="65%">

With a constant downfront surface stress (right panels)
dipoles do not emerge from the front. This is because the front is advected
by the Ekman transport in the same direction as the dipole propagation
at a slightly faster rate than the dipole can propagate.
---
## Vertical strucure of dipoles
<img src="/img/arctic_dipoles/rv_vert_stress_comp_day44.jpg" width="60%" align="left">

The vertical structure of the dipoles shows why they are subject to
breakup by a surface stress.

With no stress (a) the dipole is `tilted',
with the cylonic component stronger near the surface and the
anticyclonic component stronger near the base of the mixed layer.
As such, with an Ekman depth of about 11 m, only the cyclone is subject
to the direct effects of the surface stress.

---
## Effect of a surface stress of dipoles

The hypothesis developed above is that dipoles can be broken up when the
surface cyclone component is subject to an Ekman transport that causes
it to travel in the direction of the Ekman flow.

We test this hypothesis by restarting the simulation with no surface
stress at the point when a dipole has formed. We then apply a surface
stress in different directions to see the effect on the dipole propagation.

## Effect of a surface stress of dipoles
<img src="/img/arctic_dipoles/day15trajectories.png" width="100%">

The dots show the trajectories for the surface cyclone (left panel) and the
sub-surface anticyclone (right panel). The colour of the dots corresponds to
the arrow showing the direction of the Ekman transport. The black dots show
the curved trajectory for the case with zero surface stress.

## Effect of a surface stress of dipoles
<img src="/img/arctic_dipoles/day15trajectories.png" width="100%">

When the Ekman transport has a component advecting the cyclone away from the
anticyclone (blue and red colours), the cyclone travels away from the anticyclone
in the direction of the Ekman transport.

---
## Effect of a surface stress of dipoles
<img src="/img/arctic_dipoles/day15trajectories.png" width="100%">

When the Ekman transport pushes the cyclone towards the anticyclone (green colours)
the entire dipole trajectory is affected.
When the Ekman transport is in the direction of the dipole (magenta colours),
the dipole remains coherent but follows a less curved path.
In both these cases the anticyclone does a fast loop of the cyclone.

## Model of eddy advection due to Ekman transport
<img src="/img/arctic_dipoles/cyclone_scaling.png" width="60%" align="right">

We derive a surface quasi-geostrophic (SQG) model for the effect of
a surface stress on a mixed layer eddy. This model predicts that when
the mixed-layer cyclone is affected only by the Ekman transport, the
translation velocity of the cyclone should be the Ekman transport divided
by the stratification depth. Comparing this against the cyclone translation
velocity in the model shows a good match.

---
## Kinematic model of eddy advection
<img src="/img/arctic_dipoles/kinemResOut0500Exp128Tx038Ty-38.png" width="100%" >

We also derive a simple kinematic model for the joint effect of dipole
self-propagation and the advection due to Ekman transport. This model
also captures the basic dynamics of the advection for each component of the
dipole.

---
## Conclusions
1. An upfront surface stress aids dipole propagation away from fronts while
a downfront stress inhibits propagation.
2. The surface cyclone component of dipoles is advected by the Ekman transport
when the Ekman layer is thinner than the mixed layer.
3. The sub-surface anticyclone is not advected by the Ekman transport
when the Ekman layer is thinner than the mixed layer.
4. Sub-surface anticyclones can be formed from the break-up of such dipoles.

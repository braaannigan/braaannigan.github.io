I'm an oceanographer at Stockholm University studying the dynamics of the turbulent ocean. My main interest is the boundary layers of the ocean where the turbulence is at its most intense.  

My aim is to improve our understanding of how the ocean works in order to help us understand past, present and future changes in climate.

An up-to-date list of publications [is kept here](http://braaannigan.github.io/publications.html),
while my [CV is here](https://www.dropbox.com/s/s38vhefzeqjuo58/Liam_Brannigan_CV_September_2016.pages?dl=0).

You can find me in a variety of places around the internet where my username is typically 'braaannigan' (which is how my surname is pronounced with a Dundalk accent!)

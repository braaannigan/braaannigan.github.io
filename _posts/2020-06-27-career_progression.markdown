In the last two years I've made a transition from research scientist in physical oceanography to data scientist in industry. I discussed this recently participated in a panel run by the Euro Geosciences Union and thought that I should share my experiences in more detail.

Overall, I'm very happy with the change I've made. The work-life balance is excellent.  As a new dad I've been able to work hard during the day but then been able to throw myself into the new set of work at home without the additional responsibilities that every academic I know has to deal with. In addition, my work at Analytics Engines has been every bit as intellectually stimulating as my research. Obviously, the change has meant that I haven't been able to focus on the environmental problems we face - though I have still had opportunities to work on environmental challenges - but I'm confident that the new set of skills I've picked up will allow me to make a fresh contribution in time.

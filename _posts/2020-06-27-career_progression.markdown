## Number of articles
The number of articles has increased over time. However, while I expected a more or less continual growth in the number of articles the reality has been quite different. There was a period of exponential growth in the first decade which saw the number of articles published increase from 40 in 1971 to 170 in 1980. Since then the number of articles has oscilliated from a nadir of 114 articles in 1992 to a peak of 228 articles in 2001.

The increase in the number of articles published is due to an increase in the number of issues per year and the number of
articles per issue. In recent years there is generally about 15 articles across 12 issues. In contrast, in 1972 there were just 4 issues and the first issue had just a single article ("A Study of the Bottom Boundary Layer of the Florida Current" by G. Weatherly).

## Length of titles
If we are looking for near-perpetual growth in oceanography the place to look is the length of article titles. These titles have seen growth from a pithy average of 62 characters in 1971 to 88 characters in 2020.  We fit a geometric model to this time series to find that title length growth is about 0.065% per annum. These longer titles are mainly due to more words in titles, but there has also been a small increase in the mean length of words in titles.

The longest title at 224 characters / 27 words is from a 2015 article: "Freshwater Flux and Spatiotemporal Simulated Runoff Variability into Ilulissat Icefjord, West Greenland, Linked to Salinity and Temperature Observations near Tidewater Glacier Margins Obtained Using Instrumented Ringed Seals". This title captures a few of the trends that have lengthened titles: greater
specificity in topic of study, location and methods along with more hints at the results.

An inspection of the shortest titles shows that longer titles are an inevitable consequence of the maturation and specialisation of a subject area. For example, it would be impossible to call an article something as simple as "The Instability of a Baroclinic Vortex" if working in the same domain today. The shortest article title of all is 1975's very straightforward "MODE tides".

## Length of abstracts
Given in the increasing length of titles I expected abstracts to grow in a similar way. However, abstracts instead grew rapidly from around 750 characters in the early years to double this length by the early 2000s with a peak of 1556 characters in 2000. Abstract length has since contracted by 10% to around 1400 characters in the most recent decade.

The longest abstract was found in the 1980 article "A Numerical Study of Loop Current Intrusions and Eddy Shedding" and came in at an awesome length of 4653 characters. Inspection of the titles for the longest abstracts shows no particular pattern in terms of the study material: observational, numerical and theoretical studies are found while the study material is similarly varied including large-scale circulation, surface wave dynamics and turbulent dynamics.

One feature that has almost disappeared in recent years is the 'tweetable' abstract - that is an abstract of less than 280 characters.  Until 2000 there were at least a few of these short abstracts every year. In recent years even the shortest
abstracts have had more than 700 characters.

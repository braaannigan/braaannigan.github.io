In the last two years I've made a transition from research scientist in physical oceanography to data scientist in industry. I discussed this recently participated in a panel run by the Euro Geosciences Union and thought that I should share the joys of this transition and lessons learnt in more detail. 

I joined Analytics Engines in April 2018 after being put in touch by a recruiter.  The process was very fast compared to the timescales of academic fellowship applications - from a chat with an interviewer through two interviews and a job offer in 4 days.  I started 2 weeks later.

In some ways I took on a position that I had heard was the most risky to take - to be the first data scientist at a company. Many have found out the perils of this position - you arrive to find that there is little quality data and spend most of your time trying just to organise it rather than generating useful insights.  In this case the risk was a little lower as I was surrounded by experienced front- and back- end software engineers who were experts in setting up databases and building visualisations. 

**Lesson number 1** Don't be the first data scientist in an organisation that doesn't have data engineering infrastructure.

I had done some machine learning in my postdoc where I looked at Bayesian time series forecasting. I soon realised that this would be of limited use. This limited utility is because it is much harder to come across time series data that is stable enough to provide useful insights outside of research. For example, in one project we had decades of reports on food fraud. However, the pattern of such fraud is that when it is detected the fraudsters jump to a new area - and there are many to choose from. This means that the level of fraud stays roughly constant in time, but the type of fraud varies in a very unpredictable way.

**Lesson number 2** Be prepared to meet much more messy data than you might be used to as a researcher.

I started to make some headway in this area by analyzing text data (i.e. NLP) related to news stories. Few climate scientists work with text data but in the private and public sector it is ubiquitous.  The challenge was that I knew I was ignorant of how to go about text analysis, but as the only data scientist I didn't have a more experienced colleague to turn to.  Instead I dived into NLP twitter and followed everyone who put out interesting stuff.  After a few months of reading blog posts and trying tutorials I started to get a grip on the current methods and was starting to do interesting stuff by myself.

**Lesson number 3** Progress in data science is much faster than in modern climate science so you have to invest time continuosly to keep up.

Some patterns of working with new tools and methods were very familiar to me from my research days. I knew not to be too surpised when things like 'much hyped new tool doesn't actually improve performance on your data' cropped up. Or when a new tool that promised to give you a massive performance acceleration turned out to actually slow things down.


Overall, I'm very happy with the change I've made. The work-life balance is excellent.  As a new dad I've been able to work hard during the day but then been able to throw myself into the new set of work at home without the additional responsibilities that every academic I know has to deal with. In addition, my work at Analytics Engines has been every bit as intellectually stimulating as my research. Obviously, the change has meant that I haven't been able to focus on the environmental problems we face - though I have still had opportunities to work on environmental challenges - but I'm confident that the new set of skills I've picked up will allow me to make a fresh contribution in time.

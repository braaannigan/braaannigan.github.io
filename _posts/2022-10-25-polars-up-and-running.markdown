# Polars: up and running!
This post was created while writing my **Data Analysis with Polars course**. 
[*Check it out on Udemy*](https://www.udemy.com/course/data-analysis-with-polars/?referralCode=A29DCDA40D369080C05A)

Sometimes the first step is the hardest, so I've made this gentle introduction to starting with Polars.

In the video we load up a CSV, explore some data and see the first big differences with Pandas.

Prefer to just go through the notebook yourself? You can find everything you need to get up and running at this Github repo: (https://github.com/braaannigan/data-analysis-with-polars)[https://github.com/braaannigan/data-analysis-with-polars].

# Don't loop over columns in Polars
This post was created while writing my **Data Analysis with Polars course**. 
[*Check it out on Udemy*](https://www.udemy.com/course/data-analysis-with-polars/?referralCode=A29DCDA40D369080C05A)

If you're writing Polars code like this
```python
for col in df.columns:
do stuff
```
then **STOP!!!!**

Instead, use **expressions** and then Polars will parallelise the loop over the columns for you. By looping explicitly in python you're killing the parallelisation.

For example if we want to count the number of unique values in every column we do
```python
df.select(pl.all().n_unique())
```

or if we wanted to count the number of unique values but only in string (Utf8) columns we do
```python
df.select(pl.col(pl.Utf8)).select(pl.all().n_unique())
```

Doing it this way with expressions will will give you the ðŸš€ performance you expect!

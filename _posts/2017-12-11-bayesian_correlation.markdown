Bayesian methods are a powerful tool for understanding uncertainty in our
datasets and the strengths and weaknesses of our models.  I'm writing a series
of blog posts about how Bayesian methods can be used in practice in oceanography.

The second post in this series shows how to estimate correlation using a
Bayesian approach.  The post is an interactive Jupyter notebook that
you can access in two ways.

## Online and interactive from the cloud
You can run the notebook from the cloud
[**by going to this repository**](https://github.com/braaannigan/explore_data) and
hitting the 'launch binder' button in the readme below the file list.  
You then hit the launch
button on the next page and wait patiently for a minute while the interactive
notebook environment is created.  You then open the 'bayes_correlation.ipynb'
notebook and you can then use it as you would a notebook on your own machine.

The first notebook 'bayes_moc_gaussian.ipynb' on fitting a statistical distribution
to a dataset is also available in the repository.

## Offline and interactive on your local machine
If you'd prefer to run the notebook on your own machine, you can clone or
download [**the same repository**](https://github.com/braaannigan/explore_data)
using the green button on the top-right of the repository page.  Cloning
or downloading the repository will also
download the data files that are in the *data* sub-directory.

I've put together an example of how you can use Bayesian inference to solve
problems in oceanography [in this notebook](http://braaannigan.github.io/bayes_moc_gaussian.html).
In this case it is characterising the variability in the Meridional
Overturning Circulation as observed with the RAPID array.

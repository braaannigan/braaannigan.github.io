# tl:dr
A small survey of oceanographers shows there is high demand for training to improve their software engineering skills. The range of topics is broad ranging from basic programming to advanced machine learning and visualisation. Overall we can see that oceanographers want training to be able to produce analysis that is more reproducible, scales to large datasets and allows them to test hypotheses more efficiently.

# Aim of the survey
The survey was developed by Gwyn Evans and Liam Brannigan. We want to develop a workshop to help researchers learn better software engineering skills. Before doing so we wanted to ask the researchers what they want to learn.

The survey is by no means comprehensive but provides a useful snapshot of the topics researchers are interested in at the moment. The survey was carried out using the Tricider tool. We provided some initial topics that researchers could vote on while allowing them to add their own. There are some obvious omissions - we focused on tools in the python ecosystem as that is how we carry out the bulk of our analysis. We also included some more generic tools that are not python-based such as version control using git.

# Survey population

The survey was open to researchers at the National Oceanography Centres in Southampton and Liverpool. The survey was initially posted only to the physical oceanography group and the bulk of respondents work in that area.

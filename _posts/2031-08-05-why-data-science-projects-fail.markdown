# How to set your money on fire with *data science*
Data science projects can be a great way to take your money and set it on fire. Avoiding such failures requires us to look carefully at previous data science projects and understanding just what went wrong. In this post I'll be looking at some common patterns that lead to data science money bonfires and thinking about how these failures can be avoided. I'll call these patterns **Dead on Arrival**, **The Money Pit**, **The Luxury** and **The Dump and Run**.

## Dead on Arrival
The **Dead on Arrival** project is doomed to failure before the first data scientist has even fired up their laptop. The project might have goals that aren't possible to meet with curent technologies or require data that doesn't exist. In other cases the data does exist but the context for the project is highly variable making any lessons learned from historic data redundant for the future.

Examples of **Dead on Arrival** projects could be 

The most common cause of a **Dead on Arrival** project is that the project has been concieved and funded without input from data scientists. This scenario is most likely where an organisation is making its first foray into the data science or machine learning world. The team have heard great things about, say, machine learning and want to get in on the action. However, they aren't aware of the fine line separating the might-be-possible from the never-gonna-happen. An agonising period will ensure when the first data scientist is employed or contracted and sees the plan. 

You can avoid ending up with a **Dead on Arrival** project by getting feedback on your project early in its development. If your organisation lacks the skills to carry out this assessment then bring someone in to kick the tires on your idea. 

## The Money Pit
First the good news: the **Money Pit** project is certainty feasible given current technology. Even better - the data exists as well. The problem is that gathering that data, cleaning it up and modelling it is going to require much more effort than you've budgeted for.

Take the first challenge of gathering the data. For your project you require some public data sources that can be scraped from the web. Building reliable web scrapers can be much harder than you realise, particularly if the website doesn't offer up its secrets easily. In addition, web scrapers are brittle and can require frequent re-building as the website changes. All of this costs money.

Once you've got your data you then need to clean it up and model it. This might be straightforward. But it might also be complicated. In addition it's hard to hurry this phase along - it often just needs good analysts to do a deep dive on the data. Finally, there are no guarantees that the modelling process will produce anything valuable at the end.

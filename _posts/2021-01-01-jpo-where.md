# Where do oceanographers study?

## Basin-level

We first divide the global ocean into the main basins with their associated marginal seas. We look for references to locations in these basins to understand the overall distribution.

The Atlantic and Pacific Oceans have been the setting for the most articles in every year bar one. The proportion of articles
set in each of the Atlantic and Pacific have been similar in most years at the start and end of the series. In the middle part of the series, however, the Atlantic was the most studied basin with up to 40% of articles being set there.

The Southern Ocean was not a major focus of research in JPO in the 1970s and 1980s with around 5% of articles referencing 
locations in the Southern Ocean each year. From 1990 onwards there has been a steady increase in interest until the recent years
when there has been a similar proportion of articles on the Southern Ocean as on the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans.

Around 10% of articles in the first decade of JPO were based on lake research - principally the American Great Lakes. These studies
subsequently declined to less than 1% of the total. This decline is presumably due to the creation of more limnology journals
and the increasing specialisation of both limnology and oceanography.

The Indian Ocean accounted for less than 5% of the articles up to 1990 and 5-10% of articles in the period since. The Arctic Ocean typically accounted for 2-3% of articles published per year until around 2010. In the last decade, Arctic Ocean studies have
accounted for 5-6% of the total.

JPO has always contained articles that are specific to a particular location (e.g. "A Determination of Horizontal Divergence in the Gulf Stream off Cape Lookout" in 1971), articles that relate to a type of region (e.g. "Zonal Penetration Scale of Model Midlatitude Jets").

We can compare the number of articles that refer to no locations compared to articles that refer to one or more than one
basins. In the first 25 years 40-50% of the articles had no specific location. From the late 1990s onwards this proportion
decreased to 30-40% of the total. This decrease may relate to a change in how oceanographers motivate their studies to be explored
in a later part.

I anticipated a rise in the number of articles that refer to multiple basins over the decades as global datasets and numerical models became available. The number of such articles has in fact doubled from around 6% to 12% of the total in recent years. The number of multi-basin studies is almost certainly undercounted here as studies that look at globally-integrated quantities (e.g. "A New Climatology of Airâ€“Sea Density Fluxes and Surface Water Mass Transformation Rates Constrained by WOCE")
are harder to capture using string-matching methods.

## Sub-basin level

We can break the analysis above down into sub-basins e.g. North Atlantic and South Atlantic. For the Southern Ocean we divide it into the open ocean Southern Ocean and the Antarctic marginal seas. Unsurprisingly we find that the North Atlantic and North Pacific dominate the contribution of the Atlantic and Pacific respectively.

More interestingly, we find that the rise in articles on the Southern Ocean is divided relatively equally between the open ocean
Southern Ocean and the Antarctic marginal seas though with the former tending to have 1-2% more articles per year. No clear trends
are apprent in the other sub-basins.

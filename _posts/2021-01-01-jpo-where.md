# Where do oceanographers study?

## Basin-level

We first divide the global ocean into the main basins with their associated marginal seas. We look for references to locations in these basins to understand the overall distribution.

The Atlantic and Pacific Oceans have been the setting for the most articles in every year bar one. The proportion of articles
set in each of the Atlantic and Pacific have been similar in most years at the start and end of the series. In the middle part of the series, however, the Atlantic was the most studied basin with up to 40% of articles being set there.

The Southern Ocean was not a major focus of research in JPO in the 1970s and 1980s with around 5% of articles referencing 
locations in the Southern Ocean each year. From 1990 onwards there has been a steady increase in interest until the recent years
when there has been a similar proportion of articles on the Southern Ocean as on the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans.

Around 10% of articles in the first decade of JPO were based on lake research - principally the American Great Lakes. These studies
subsequently declined to less than 1% of the total. This decline is presumably due to the creation of more limnology journals
and the increasing specialisation of both limnology and oceanography.

The Indian Ocean accounted for less than 5% of the articles up to 1990 and 5-10% of articles in the period since. The Arctic Ocean typically accounted for 2-3% of articles published per year until around 2010. In the last decade, Arctic Ocean studies have
accounted for 5-6% of the total.

JPO has always contained articles that are specific to a particular location (e.g. "A Determination of Horizontal Divergence in the Gulf Stream off Cape Lookout" in 1971), articles that relate to a type of region (e.g. "Zonal Penetration Scale of Model Midlatitude Jets").

We can compare the number of articles that refer to no locations compared to articles that refer to one or more than one
basins. In the first 25 years 40-50% of the articles had no specific location. From the late 1990s onwards this proportion
decreased to 30-40% of the total. This decrease may relate to a change in how oceanographers motivate their studies to be explored
in a later part.

I anticipated a rise in the number of articles that refer to multiple basins over the decades as global datasets and numerical models became available. The number of such articles has in fact doubled from around 6% to 12% of the total in recent years. The number of multi-basin studies is almost certainly undercounted here as studies that look at globally-integrated quantities (e.g. "A New Climatology of Airâ€“Sea Density Fluxes and Surface Water Mass Transformation Rates Constrained by WOCE")
are harder to capture using string-matching methods.

## Sub-basin level

We can break the analysis above down into sub-basins e.g. North Atlantic and South Atlantic. For the Southern Ocean we divide it into the open ocean Southern Ocean and the Antarctic marginal seas. Unsurprisingly we find that the North Atlantic and North Pacific dominate the contribution of the Atlantic and Pacific respectively.

More interestingly, we find that the rise in articles on the Southern Ocean is divided relatively equally between the open ocean
Southern Ocean and the Antarctic marginal seas though with the former tending to have 1-2% more articles per year. No clear trends
are apprent in the other sub-basins.

## Currents
![Number of articles per current](/img/currentsTotal.svg)

Many of these geographic studies focus on the major current systems. The Gulf Stream is the most studied current, with references to it in 6% of JPO articles. This is followed by the Kuroshio and Antarctic Circumpolar Currents with about 3% of articles
referring to each of these current systems. The Agulhas is referred to in 1% of articles.

The other major group of currents referenced in JPO are the various equatorial currents. Equatorial currents and undercurrents are found in the Pacific, Atlantic and Indian Oceans. However, it is challengiing to determine exactly which one is being referred to with simple rules, so they have all been lumped together here. Inspection of the articles suggests that the majority of the articles refer to the equatorial currents in the Pacific.

The number of articles devoted to other currents is very small. The 14th most referenced current is the Somali 
current that is referred to in 0.2% of articles - this is just 15 articles over 50 years. As such estimating trends is 
only feasible in the most-referenced currents.

The Gulf Stream was the primary focus for the first half of the time series with 7-10% of articles each year. From 1994 until 2010
there was a steady decrease in the number of articles that refer to the Gulf Stream downb to less than 2% of articles in 2010. In recent years 3-5% of articles have referred to the Gulf Stream. 

The Kuroshio has gained in interest through most of the period. In the early years it was referred to less than 2% of time - which 
corresponds to 1-2 articles per year in that period - to about 5% of articles more recently. 

The most dramatic change in interest has been in the Antarctic Circumpolar Current (ACC). In the first six years of the journal a circumpolar current was only referred to twice in the context of global ocean simulations. From 1987 onwards the references to the
ACC undergo almost continual increase until a peak of about 6% of articles in 2014.  The range of topics expanded from the initial focus on hydrography (e.g. "Structure and Transport of the Antarctic Circumpolar Current at Drake Passage from Short-Term Measurements") to the controls of the ACC (e.g. "Equilibration of the Antarctic Circumpolar Current by Standing Meanders") and its
role in ocean mixing (e.g. "Direct Estimate of Lateral Eddy Diffusivity Upstream of Drake Passage").
